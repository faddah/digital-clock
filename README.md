# Digital Clock

## Made in JavaScript
## Can also be a Google Chrome Browser Extension by using the `manifest.json` file

### This was taken from [this YouTube instructional video on making a JavaScript Digital Clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tC46h022YE) by [GreatStack](https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev).

I have taken this code and adjusted the CSS and such and added a manifest.json and icon files to make it into a Google Chrome Browser extension.
